## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions:

### **Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**

2. Repository name: `portfolio`
3. Set to **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
4. **Don't check** "Add a README file"
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### **Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub**

Open PowerShell/Command Prompt in your Portfolio folder and run these commands:

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:**

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Example (if your username is `aleemshahzad`):**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/aleemshahzad/portfolio.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### **Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages**
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll to **Pages** section (left sidebar)
4. Under **Build and deployment**:
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main**
   - Folder: **/ (root)**
5. Click **Save**

### **Step 4: Access Your Live Website**
Your website will be available at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/portfolio
```

**Example:**

⏰ **Note:** It may take 5-10 minutes for the site to be live after enabling GitHub Pages.

## 🎯 Quick Commands Summary:

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/portfolio.git
